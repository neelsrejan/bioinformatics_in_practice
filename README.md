# Bioinformatics in practice

## Background info
The project was to use bioinformatics tools and techniques to recreate the figures and results from the paper "A genome-wide association study of deafness in three canine breeds" (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0232900). The presentation and report go into details of tools and methodology followed to recreate and validate the claims and result of the article.
